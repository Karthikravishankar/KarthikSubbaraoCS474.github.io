<li>Newtons First Law of Motion:
<ul>
<li>Newton’s first law states that, if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force.</li>

<li>Einstein’s mass-energy equation: E = m<span class="math inline">\(c^2\)</span></li>
<li>Time complexity of quick sort on average in Big O notation: O(nlogn)</li>

<li>It will need a minimum of 5 dimensions</li>
<li>Because in one hot encoding, we will use [0,0,0,0,1] to represent the last class and [1,0,0,0,0] for the first class</li>
<li>Hence, it needs 5 dimensions</li>
